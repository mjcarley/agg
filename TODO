* derivatives of surfaces (this needs differentiation of transforms,
  and of sections including derivatives of coefficients from Lagrange
  interpolants)
  
* (loadable) database of sections

* evaluation of vmin(u), vmax(u) on sections in surfaces

* use triangle to mesh surfaces

* intersection evaluation without intermediate patches

* listing of available affine transforms
